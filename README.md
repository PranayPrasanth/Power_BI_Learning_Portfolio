# Power BI Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning **Power BI** using a dataset on **Data Jobs**.  
The project covers essential and advanced chart types, navigation design, and a **final interactive dashboard** that compiles all insights into a single report.

## Project Overview

The Power BI report (`.pbix` file) is structured into multiple tabs, each focusing on specific visualization techniques:

- **Home Tab**: Landing page with buttons for navigation across report pages.  
- **Column & Bar Charts**: Vertical, horizontal, and stacked bar/column charts.  
- **Line & Area Charts**: Line charts, area charts, and combo visualizations.  
- **Common Charts**: Pie, donut, clustered charts, and standard visuals.  
- **Map Charts**: Filled maps, bubble maps, and geospatial visualizations.  
- **Uncommon Charts**: Funnel, waterfall, scatter plots, and other less common charts.  
- **Tables**: Matrix tables, conditional formatting, and tabular insights.  
- **Cards**: Single-number KPIs and multi-row cards.  
- **Slicers**: Filters, dropdowns, and advanced slicer interactions.  
- **Main Dashboard**: Final interactive dashboard combining insights from all visual types.  
- **Drill Through**: Detailed drill-through pages for deeper analysis.

## Learning Goals

- Understand and apply all major chart types in Power BI.  
- Practice report navigation with buttons and bookmarks.  
- Build a clean and interactive dashboard from scratch.  
- Learn to use drill-throughs and slicers for better data storytelling.

## How to Use

1. Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.  
2. Open it in **Power BI Desktop**.  
3. Navigate through the tabs using the **Home page buttons**.  
4. Explore the **final dashboard** and drill-through functionality.

## Future Enhancements

- Add **custom visuals** from the Power BI marketplace.  
- Experiment with **DAX measures** for deeper analytics.  
- Extend the dashboard with **real-world datasets**.
